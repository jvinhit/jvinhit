I'm a software engineer based in Viet Nam :flag-vn:.

Currently, I'm a Senior Developer for Front-end Developer!

Ultimately, what I want you to know most about me is that I love solving complex problems and building awesome things. Particularly with C# or JavaScript. Then, I talk about it and create resources for other devs to do the same. Most of those resources end up here!

Thank you for stopping by!
